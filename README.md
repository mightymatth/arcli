```
➜  ~ arcli i ls

```

Log spent time (l) for issue (i) with ID 20123 with time duration (-t) of 1.5
hours.

```

On freshly installed Redmine server, REST API web service is turned off by
default. To turn it on, go to browser, open Redmine server URL, log in with
administrator, go to **Administrator tab > Settings > API tab** and turn on **Enable REST web service** option.
